# Dockerfiles

A repository for various dockerfiles, aimed at creating a reproducable
environment for myself.

Assuming all the containers have been built, run install.sh to symlink them
into ~/.bin. If you add this to your path you will then be able to execute
a specific container by using the name of the folder it is in.
